# Archaeological Site Mapping with Python and Folium

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Python, specifically leveraging the Folium library, to map archaeological sites worldwide. By fetching data from Wikidata using SPARQL queries and visualizing this data on an interactive map, we provide insights into various historical sites' geographical distribution and details. This project is an excellent example of combining data science with historical and archaeological research, showcasing the power of Python for geospatial analysis.

## Features

- **Data Fetching:** Utilizes SPARQL queries to retrieve data about archaeological sites from Wikidata.
- **Geospatial Visualization:** Employs the Folium library to plot the locations of archaeological sites on an interactive map.
- **Image Integration:** Includes direct links to images of the sites, enhancing the user experience by providing visual context.
- **Interactive Popups:** Each site on the map features an interactive popup containing details about the site, such as its name, description, discovery date, and a link to view more images.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Folium for geospatial mapping
- SPARQL for querying Wikidata
- Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab for project development and presentation

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/polyphemus287/archaeological_site_wikidata.git
   
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment:**

   You can use Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab to open the `.ipynb` file.

4. **Run the notebook:**

   Execute the cells sequentially to fetch the data, process it, and generate the interactive map.
